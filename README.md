## Usage

Upon running the application, you will see a window titled "Dikdik" with a menu bar at the top. The menu bar consists of a "File" menu and a "Help" menu.

- The "File" menu has a single option, "Quit," which allows you to exit the application.
- The "Help" menu has an "About" option that displays information about the application.

In the main window, you will find the following components:

- A welcome text centered in the window.
- An image of a Dik-dik (an antelope species).
- A "Random" button.

Clicking the "Random" button will fetch a random Dik-dik image from the KuteGoAPIURL and update the displayed image accordingly.

You can close the application by clicking the "Quit" option in the "File" menu or by pressing the Escape key.
